# UnitTestsExample

This project is a simple example of a calculator application built with .NET 8. It includes basic arithmetic operations and unit tests to demonstrate how to write and run tests using xUnit.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two integers and returns the result.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second integer from the first and returns the result.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two integers and returns the result.
- **Division**: Divides the first integer by the second and returns the result. Throws an exception if attempting to divide by zero.

## Unit Tests

The project includes a set of unit tests to verify the correctness of the calculator operations. The tests are written using the xUnit framework and cover the following scenarios:

- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers
- Division by zero (expected to throw an exception)

## Getting Started

To run the application and tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Build the solution to restore the necessary packages.
4. Run the tests using the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.
